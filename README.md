cPanel cleanup (and monitoring)

I host a few sites on a hosting service that uses cPanel and WebHostManager and recently started getting alerts that my sites were running out of space.  I initially created a script that would SSH into each of the servers and remove temporary files but am now (as of 17 June 2015) working on scripting the monitoring of the sites from within a bash script.
